post-title: From universal languages to medical terminologies
---

When I was 12, I received a Walkman to celebrate finishing primary school. One summer night, while I was playing around with the tuner wheel looking for good music, I stumbled upon a radio show with a humorous take on science and art topics. I have been listening to the show since then, following it for over 25 years. 

In one of its latest episodes, the host discusses John Wilkins' intent to create a language to be spoken and understood by all of the world's people. The discussion immediately captured my attention.

In 1668, John Wilkins - an English natural philosopher- proposed a universal language to facilitate communication between scholars, diplomats, travelers, and merchants on his _An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language_. 

The essay presents a classification scheme composed of elementary building to refer to every possible thing and notion of the universe. The classification scheme comprises _Generas_, which are divided into _Differences_, which are in turn divided into _Species_. By combining the elements of the classification scheme at the different levels you get an 4-letters Character representing a concept: 2 letters from the Genera, 1 from the Difference, and 1 from the Specie. 
For example, __flame__ is represented by the Character __deba__. The _de_ for elements, the _b_ for the fire, and the _a_ for a part of it. What if you need to represent __a drop of water__? Just replace the _b_ (fire) for the _t_ (water): __deta__ represents a part of the water element.

These examples demonstrate the the Wilkins’ approach for an universal language was to create a systematic and logical language where the structure of the word convey both its meaning and relationship with other concepts.

At that stage, I couldn’t avoid the temptation of tracing a link between this essay from SXVII and the current medical terminologies.

Let’s take the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an example. ICD contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstance, and external causes of injury or diseases. Using ICD10, the __type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal complications__ is coded as __E11.2__. The _E_ for the chapter of Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases; the _11_ for the type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the _2_ for the renal complications. There are even more specific examples, like S82.101A. The _S_ for injuries, the _82_ for the anatomical site, the _101_ to further specify the injury, and the _A_ to provide additional information on the encounter. Then __S82.101A__ is the __encounter initial of an unspecified fracture of upper end of tibia__.

See the linkage? 

Perhaps the Wilkins’ ambition of a universal language may sound unrealistic but the principles underlying it are applied today, i.e.: _300+ years later_. I’d say that’s something. 

And yes, the current terminologies focus on a domain and their categorization schemes show higher quality in terms of exhaustiveness, mutual exclusivity, consistency granularity, etc. 


___But have you ever tried to vocalize an ICD10 code? Point for Wilkins!___
