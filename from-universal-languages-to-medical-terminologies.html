<h1>From universal languages to medical terminologies</h1>
<p>When I was 12, I received a Walkman to celebrate finishing primary school. One summer night, while I was playing around with the tuner wheel looking for good music, I stumbled upon a radio show with a humorous take on science and art topics. I have been listening to the show since then, following it for over 25 years.</p>
<p>In one of its latest episodes, the host discusses John Wilkins’ intent to create a language to be spoken and understood by all of the world’s people. The discussion immediately captured my attention.</p>
<p>In 1668, John Wilkins - an English natural philosopher- proposed a universal language to facilitate communication between scholars, diplomats, travelers, and merchants on his <em>An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language</em>.</p>
<p>The essay presents a classification scheme composed of elementary building to refer to every possible thing and notion of the universe. The classification scheme comprises <em>Generas</em>, which are divided into <em>Differences</em>, which are in turn divided into <em>Species</em>. By combining the elements of the classification scheme at the different levels you get an 4-letters Character representing a concept: 2 letters from the Genera, 1 from the Difference, and 1 from the Specie. For example, <strong>flame</strong> is represented by the Character <strong>deba</strong>. The <em>de</em> for elements, the <em>b</em> for the fire, and the <em>a</em> for a part of it. What if you need to represent <strong>a drop of water</strong>? Just replace the <em>b</em> (fire) for the <em>t</em> (water): <strong>deta</strong> represents a part of the water element.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate the Wilkins’ approach for an universal language was to create a systematic and logical language where the structure of the word convey both its meaning and relationship with other concepts.</p>
<p>At that stage, I couldn’t avoid the temptation of tracing a link between this essay from SXVII and the current medical terminologies.</p>
<p>Let’s take the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an example. ICD contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstance, and external causes of injury or diseases. Using ICD10, the <strong>type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal complications</strong> is coded as <strong>E11.2</strong>. The <em>E</em> for the chapter of Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases; the <em>11</em> for the type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the <em>2</em> for the renal complications. There are even more specific examples, like S82.101A. The <em>S</em> for injuries, the <em>82</em> for the anatomical site, the <em>101</em> to further specify the injury, and the <em>A</em> to provide additional information on the encounter. Then <strong>S82.101A</strong> is the <strong>encounter initial of an unspecified fracture of upper end of tibia</strong>.</p>
<p>See the linkage?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Wilkins’ ambition of a universal language may sound unrealistic but the principles underlying it are applied today, i.e.: <em>300+ years later</em>. I’d say that’s something.</p>
<p>And yes, the current terminologies focus on a domain and their categorization schemes show higher quality in terms of exhaustiveness, mutual exclusivity, consistency granularity, etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>But have you ever tried to vocalize an ICD10 code? Point for Wilkins!</em></strong></p>
